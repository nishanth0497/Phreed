 # Phreed

**Welcome to Phreed, a networking platform for researchers**.

## Vision
Our platform is to be a one-stop solution for the research community. We intend to develop a platform that helps students connect with professors with ease of access and at the same time enjoy the perks of being a part of social media. 

Our platform will enable them to communicate freely without prejudices and nurture their overall interest in connecting and learning. In the next few months, we plan to go to the beta stage by developing our platform with our prime features and bringing in the first funding round for further development.
## Mission
Many of the social media platforms that are currently in the market do not cater to the needs of the research community. So we came up with a platform that enables a safe, technologically sound, and curated which focuses not only on productivity but also catering to the fun part of life. With several novel features, our vision is to create Phreed into a wholesome place for the scientific community.
